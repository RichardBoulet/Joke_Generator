Joke_Generator Repo

Repo with the goal of creating automated script with cron that scrapes the r/jokes thread on Reddit on a recuring basis. The scraped jokes are then used to train a NLP model that when given a prompt, can return a joke. The joke dat will be stored on AWS database and the ML model will be deployed via Streamlit.io.
